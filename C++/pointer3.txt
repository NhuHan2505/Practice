Why should we use delete?
To avoid wastage of memory, you can dynamically allocate memory required during runtime using new and delete operator in C++.

When we use delete?
As soon as you create a dynamic object, this calling the new operator, you need to call delete somewhere.

Difference between delete and delete[]
The delete operator deallocates memory and calls the destructor for a single object created with new.

The delete [] operator deallocates memory and calls destructors for an array of objects created with new [].

Write a demo
int main()
{
	//for a single object
	int *a=new int();
	delete a;
	//for an array of object
	int (*b)[]= new int();
	delete []b;
}
